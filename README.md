## Serious Projects

* [gene](https://github.com/chickazee4/gene) - easy, tiny command line tool for truncating and reformatting nucleotide sequences. written for linux glibc but should be pretty easy to port to any other unixoid. 
* [heirloom-ports](https://github.com/chickazee4/heirloom-ports) - cmake-based ports of classic Unix software, or in some cases, faithful rewrites, to modern Unixoid platforms, based on the now-defunct heirloom project. Unfinished and not maintained.
* [libstarling/starling2csv](https://github.com/chickazee4/starling) - a Unix library and program for interfacing with Starling linguistic databases and converting them to CSV tables.
* [myna](https://github.com/chickazee4/myna) - a GUI interface to libstarling (see above). allows browsing and modifying linguistic databases before turning them into CSVs.

## silly / limited use cases

* [digital compost bin](https://github.com/chickazee4/digitalcompostbin) - gradually corrupt specific files until they're unrecognizable
* [echo.go](https://github.com/chickazee4/echo.go) - simple, fast out-of-memory exception generator
* [mcum](https://github.com/chickazee4/mcum) - Discord bot that sporadically turns a target user's messages into boomer memes, which it will then send
* [webnoise](https://github.com/chickazee4/webnoise) - generate constant arbitrary network traffic to a website or list of websites
* [mynix](https://github.com/chickazee4/mynix) - my NixOS configuration (not really for public use, but it's available if you *want* to use it)
