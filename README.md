# chickazee4

i have a lot of smaller projects, which are only increasing in number, that warrant a better listing format than github provides by default. here's a categorical listing of my repositories:

## linux

* [desmume-cmake](https://github.com/chickazee4/desmume-cmake) - port of the nintendo DS emulator desmume to the CMake build platform, intended mostly for embedding the software in larger projects. this is theoretically platform-agnostic but i haven't actually added windows build support so i'm putting it here.
* [libunwind-musl-x86-build-scripts](https://github.com/chickazee4/libunwind-musl-x86-build-scripts) - exactly what it says in the name
* [mynix](https://github.com/chickazee4/mynix) - my NixOS configuration (not really for public use, but it's available if you *want* to)
* [slackbuilds](https://github.com/chickazee4/slackbuilds) - binary packages generated from SlackBuilds.org scripts, compatible with Slackware64-current
* [spotify-tumbleweed](https://github.com/chickazee4/spotify-tumbleweed) - script to install spotify on openSUSE or other neglected distributions that lack a native spotify package - NOT MAINTAINED

## platform-agnostic/general unix

* [gene](https://github.com/chickazee4/gene) - easy, tiny command line tool for truncating and reformatting nucleotide sequences. written for linux glibc but should be pretty easy to port to any other unixoid. 
* [heirloom-ports](https://github.com/chickazee4/heirloom-ports) - cmake-based ports of classic Unix software, or in some cases, faithful rewrites, to modern Unixoid platforms, based on the now-defunct heirloom project

## fun gimmicky things / limited use cases

* [digital compost bin](https://github.com/chickazee4/digitalcompostbin) - gradually corrupt specific files until they're unrecognizable
* [echo.go](https://github.com/chickazee4/echo.go) - simple, fast out-of-memory exception generator
* [trollface](https://github.com/chickazee4/trollface) - output one of several types of ASCII trollfaces to the console
* [webnoise](https://github.com/chickazee4/webnoise) - generate constant arbitrary network traffic to a website or list of websites
